 * BigDataViewer Playground Action --
 * Appends a {@link SourceAndConverter} into a {@link BdvHandle}

 * Note :
 * - if a SourceAndConverter is already present, it is not duplicated, the addition
 * is ignored silently
 *
 * - the functional interface allows to use this action in a functional way,
 * in this case, the constructor without SourceAndConverter can be used
 *
 * TODO : think if this action is useful ? It looks ununsed because the direct call to SourceAndConverterServices.getSourceAndConverterDisplayService().show is more convenient
